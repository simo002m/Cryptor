# Cryptor
Cryptor is a simple and easy-to-use encryption/decryption tool for the terminal. the language it's written in is Python 3. It's what GCryptor is built on.

To install/configure it for Linux so that it appears as a command then type:

sudo bash Linux/install.sh

To uninstall it:

sudo bash Linux/uninstall.sh

If you run it without the sudo, it's not going to work.
maybe this works for MacOS as well but I'm not quite sure since I don't own a MacBook.


To install it in Termux(A terminal emulator and Linux environment for Android):

bash Linux/Termux/install.sh

To uninstall it:

bash Linux/Termux/uninstall.sh

You don't need to be root(sudo) to do this. In fact it's most like not going to work if you are.
