# Cryptor
Cryptor is a simple and easy-to-use encryption/decryption tool for the terminal. the language it's written in is Python 3. It's what GCryptor is built on.

To install/configure it for Linux so that it appears as a command then type:

sudo bash Linux_Install_Script.sh

If you run it without the sudo, it's not going to work.
maybe this works for MacOS as well but I'm not quite sure since I don't own a MacBook.
